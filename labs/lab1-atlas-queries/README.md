# Atlas Queries Lab

Try using Atlas queries to solve the following challenges. You may choose to create a simple project to have something to test against but your queries should be generic enough to handle any project.

Problem 0) Playing with the call graph and contains edges. Examine the queries in the HelloWorld.txt file in this directory.

Problem 1) Let methods B and F be sensitive methods.  Return the subset of the sensitive methods that were called.

Problem 2) Answer if map is a "java.util.Collection" subtype.

Problem 3) Find all calls within the app to custom collection type constructors.  Define a custom collection type to be a class that inherits from java.util.Collection and is defined within the app (your project).
