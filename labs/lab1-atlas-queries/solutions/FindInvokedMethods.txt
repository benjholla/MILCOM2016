Problem Statement: Let methods B and F be sensitive methods.  Return the subset of the sensitive methods that were called.

var B = app.methods("B")
var F = app.methods("F")
var sensitive = B.union(F)
var callEdges = universe.edgesTaggedWithAny(XCSG.Call).retainEdges()
var sensitiveMethodCallers = callEdges.predecessors(sensitive)
var calledSensitiveMethods = callEdges.successors(sensitiveMethodCallers).intersection(sensitive)
show(calledSensitiveMethods)
